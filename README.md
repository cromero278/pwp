Project & files are set up to spec. Code could use some clean up as the indentation is off and does not match the style guide. Please see one of us if you need further explanation.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. 

## Milestone 2a
Your content strategy and wireframes look great! You clearly used a mobile first design which will make your development easier, and you have a simple, straightforward plan for your site which will translate really well. In your HTML make sure to indent things inside of the li tags. Otherwise your HTML looks good.

Overall really great job on your Milestone 2a! It passes at a Tier III and you can move on to development.
